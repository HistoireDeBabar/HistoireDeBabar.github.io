		<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				Hello, and Welcome to my Github Page!
				I'm a 25 year old developer from the North East of England.
				By day I'm a professional web application developer for SaleCycle,
				where I help to create a scalable cloud based re-marketing app.  We use
				a hole host of technologies including, but not limited to C#, Couchbase and
				Knockout.js.
				<br />
				By night I'm a hobby developer enthusiast.  I create little projects for the fun of learning new technologies, patterns and
				practices.  Some of those projects end up on GitHub so feel free to have a snoop around!
				<br />
				Adios amigos!
